# Description:
-----
This is the server side of an application that me and my teammate develop as our final project for the Telerik Academy ALPHA 
program. This is a Spring boot application which serves as the server of an Android application. The server uses MariaDB as its
database(DB scripts with the model and test data included). The application itself tries to solve the sometimes difficult communication
between tenants and landlords by providing chat functionality and other useful features.
